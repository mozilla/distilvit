If you used the model and detected a poorly described image, you can help us by sending that image to us so we can add it into our training datasets.

You can also create a dataset on HF to fix some of the class imbalances or simply add more quality data.

The dataset should contain the following fields:
- image: the image in PNG, with a maximum width or height of 700 pixels.
- source: the source of the image
- license : the license of the image
